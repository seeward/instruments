# Instruments

A set of Phaser musical components built in TypeScript.

__Metronome__ - has a slider that controls the BMP and sets the global BPM in its constructor

__Keyboard__ - loads synth configurations remotely from the server. Includees distortion and delay effects. Handles live WebMidi events to the selected synth

__Drum Machine__ - A controller for generic step sequencer elements

__Recorder__ - Basic recording of inputs - can handle mic or software inputs

- Swap different sample kits in Drum Machine
- Add routing and record busses to Recorder
- Save entire Drum Machine session (vol, reverb levels, etc)
- Add swing control
- Add selectable effects to Drum Machine 
- Import / Export Patterns
